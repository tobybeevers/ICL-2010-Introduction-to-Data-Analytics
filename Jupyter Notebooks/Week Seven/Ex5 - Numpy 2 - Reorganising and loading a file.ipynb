    "Why do we reorganise\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays in NumPy are reorganized for several important reasons:\n",
    "- Changing data structure: Reshaping allows you to modify the dimensions of an array without altering its data, enabling you to adapt the array to different computational needs or data representations.\n",
    "- Performance optimization: Reordering array elements can improve memory access patterns and cache utilization, potentially leading to faster computations.\n",
    "- Data analysis: Reorganizing arrays facilitates various data analysis tasks, such as combining multiple datasets, extracting specific subsets of data, or preparing data for specific algorithms.\n",
    "- Compatibility: Reshaping arrays can make them compatible with other functions or libraries that expect input data in a particular shape or format.\n",
    "- Visualization: Changing array shapes can be necessary for proper data visualization, such as converting a 1D array into a 2D array for image processing\n",
